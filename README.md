# pandas challenge
 Please check the one named HeroesOfPymoli_homework.ipynb.
 I didn't comment every entry since pandas is much more stright than python, easy to build the logic there. But I did leave 2 comments with my questions,which there are two parts' results not quite the same although I'm pretty confident with my code. Those 3 requred observations I put them at the bottle of my code. Please leave comments about my homework, I really like to read them. Thank you very much for the time.
